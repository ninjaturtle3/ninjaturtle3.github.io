If I'm being completely honest, I decided to steer in the direction of software development in order to keep up and adapt myself to today's digital age. Adaptability is a skill of it's own, which we are all forced to learn, one way or another, by taking on challenges while dealing with confusion and a dash of delusion. The ability to adapt and overcome small and great challenges is indeed what makes life interesting and worth it. Not all things go as planned and that's okay. This reminds me of the the *if, else* statements:

```
software_dev = "perseverance + effort"
  if software_dev == "perseverance + effort"
      puts "Congrats, your hard work has paid off. Keep learning!"
  else
    puts "Sorry...try something else! You got this :)."
    
  end
```

My coding experience has been brief and this will probably, *hopefully*, change in the next few months. This will be challenging --the past couple of days I have been made fully aware (by a dear and talented software engineer friend) that the Learn platform should only serve as a guideline and that it is my responsibility/aim (if I want to succeed as a software developer), to put all new skills acquired to the test and to practice coding outside of the platform. That is, after all, what all of us in this program want to achieve...to successfully implement the new set of skills that the Learn platform will arm us with. I can't lie, I'm a bit nervous as well as excited and ready as can be! 

Wishing everyone on this great journey great luck and perseverance.
